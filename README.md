# Big Data Sales Forecasting Model Using XGBoost and Hyperparameter Optimization 

This repository presents an advanced Big Data Sales Forecasting Model leveraging the power of XGBoost and comprehensive Hyperparameter Tuning. Designed to simulate large-scale sales data with complex seasonality, promotional impacts, and upward trends, this model demonstrates state-of-the-art machine learning practices for accurate sales prediction.

## Overview
This project tackles the challenges of time-series forecasting in the retail domain by generating a synthetic, high-volume dataset and applying sophisticated feature engineering techniques. The model utilizes:

* Gradient Boosting with XGBoost for superior predictive accuracy.
* GridSearchCV for exhaustive hyperparameter tuning.
* Feature Engineering to extract temporal patterns, trends, and seasonality.

The end-to-end pipeline ensures a robust, scalable, and highly efficient solution to forecasting problems in retail analytics, demand planning, and inventory management.
